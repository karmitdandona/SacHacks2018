Recognized by Smartcar for "Best Smartcar Hack" at SacHacks 2018

## Description
SmartMaintain is a webapp delivering an environment-based predictive car maintenance algorithm. Utilizing several APIs to access environmental conditions from a vehicle's location, such as climate, temperature, and air quality, in addition to a car's odometer, a historical feed of a vehicle's data is developed. Once a vehicle is authenticated into our system, this data is queried and stored every hour, 24/7.

Every supported make and model of a car can have its own unique maintenance schedule pre-programmed into our system, but this can be affected by these external conditions involving the usage of a car within various environments. Additionally, the predicted maintenace schedules are broken down by individual components of the vehicle, enabling vehicle owners to monitor the vehicle on a more granular level and view any potential lost mileage. By leveraging this data, a highly accurate model of car maintenance can be designed.

The monitoring system is also automated and will notify users via SMS as their predicted maintenance approaches for specific components, helping to keep the vehicle in the best shape possible.
