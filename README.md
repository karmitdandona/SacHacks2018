#### SmartMaintain is a webapp centered around predictive car maintenance algorithms. Using environment and location-based data, in addition to a car’s odometer, a historical feed of a vehicles’ data is developed. Every make and model of a car has its own unique maintenance schedule, but this can be affected by external conditions involving the usage of a car within various environments. By leveraging this vehicle-specific data with these conditions, a highly accurate model of car maintenance can be designed utilizing data such as air quality, temperature, and climate, in addition to the usage of the car through the odometer. Once a vehicle is authenticated into our system, it remains there while corresponding data is queried at regular intervals every hour 24/7. Additionally, the predicted maintenance schedules are broken down by individual components of the vehicle, rather than maintenance as a whole, enabling vehicle owners to monitor the vehicle on a more granular level and view any potential lost mileage. This monitoring system is also automated and will notify users via SMS as their predicted maintenance approaches, helping to keep the vehicle in the best shape possible.
